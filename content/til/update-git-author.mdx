title: Update git commit author and email for all commits in repo without changing original commit date

GitHub has the feature where they [provide you with a `noreply`
email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/reference/email-addresses-reference#your-noreply-email-address)
to protect the privacy of your main email and will block you from pushing if you
tries to push commits that contain your real email.  I have multiple repos that
I commited with the "wrong" email address, which causes problem when I try to
push them to GitHub for archiving

This command
([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41301627/how-to-update-git-commit-author-but-keep-original-date-when-amending))
will change the commit author's name and email address, while keeping the
original commit date unmodified
```bash
git -c rebase.instructionFormat='%s%nexec GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="%cD"
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="%aD" \
git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author' rebase -f <commit/branch before wrong author and email, or --root to rebase all> 
```

Note that this will also change all commits' hashes.
