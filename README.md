# Personal Blog
Welcome to my (temporary) personal blog. I chose GitHub for its nice Markdown and LaTeX support. All blog posts can be found under [blog-archive](https://github.com/BlacCod/blog/tree/blog-archive) branch.

A custom blog website is in the work, with support for interactive animation and visualization.

List of blog posts:
